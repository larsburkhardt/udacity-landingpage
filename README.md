# Landing Page Project
made by Lars Burkhardt with the help of lots of coffee
## Table of Contents

Tried to keep the code clean and sorted.

There is an option to hide the header on scroll, but I decided to deactivate the event listener cause of unconvenience of this interactivity

## Functionalities
- Smooth scroll when clicking link in navbar
- Highlighting link when scrolling to corresponding section
- Section gets highlighted when into view
- Scroll-to-top button added, placed right bottom of the page
